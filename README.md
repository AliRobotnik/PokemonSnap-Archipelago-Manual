## Playing The Randomizer
Since this is  a manual Archipelago Randomizer, you must first have a completed file of Pokemon Snap. The randomizer starts when hitting “Continue” on the title screen. At the start of the run you only have 15 film per level visit and cannot use any of your items (Pokemon Food, Pester Ball, Poke Flute, Dash Engine) nor can you take picutres of Pokemon Signs. Select the check in the manual called "Zero-One" to reveal which level you unlock first. Go to that level sand start taking pics of pokemon! As Oak grades them you can mark any checks you completed and see what new items or levels you acquired. Your goal is to acquire 6 Pokemon Sign pics to unlock Rainbow Cloud and capture Mew on film. The run ends when Oak finishes grading your Mew pic.
